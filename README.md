# Python-Bootcamp-Projects
A collection of Python projects created during the Exelerate Asia and K-Youth Python bootcamp. Includes a simple web app using Flask and data analysis with Pandas.

This repository contains two Python projects developed during the Python bootcamp with Exelerate Asia and K-Youth. The projects showcase the usage of Flask for a simple web app and Pandas for data analysis. 

## Project Details

### Flask Web App
- The Flask web app in this repository utilizes data from two APIs:
  - **Joke API:** Fetches random jokes to display on the web app. You can find the API [here](https://jokeapi.dev/?authuser=0).
  - **Country API:** Retrieves information about various countries to display on the web app. The API can be found [here](https://restcountries.com/?authuser=0).

The Flask web app demonstrates basic web development using Python, serving as a great starting point for web development beginners.

### Data Analysis with Pandas
- The data analysis project in this repository focuses on working with a dataset of anime published from 2000 to the present. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalmane10/anime-dataset-2022/?authuser=0).

The Pandas data analysis project highlights the power of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis in Python. You can explore data trends, filter information, and generate valuable insights from the provided dataset.

## Project Structure
